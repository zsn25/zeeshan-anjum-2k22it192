Boostly is a system made for college students to appreciate and reward each other.
It’s like a mini social platform where students can send credits to their friends for doing something good, get recognized by others, and later redeem those credits for real rewards.
Built with:
Node.js and Express.js for the backend
MongoDB and Mongoose for the database
 Main Features (What the System Does)
 Recognition System
Students can send credits to their friends to say “thank you” or “well done.”
Rules:
Everyone gets 100 credits every month.
You can’t send credits to yourself.

You can’t send more than what you currently have.

You can’t send more than 100 credits total in one month.

Every new month, your credits and sending limit reset automatically.

2.Endorsement System

Other students can endorse (like or cheer for) a recognition post someone else received.

Rules:

One person can endorse a recognition only once.

Endorsements don’t cost credits — they just show support.

They count toward leaderboard ranking.

3. Redemption System

Students can redeem their earned credits for real rewards or vouchers.

Rules:

1 credit = ₹5

When redeemed, the credits are permanently used.

Only received credits can be redeemed, not the ones you send.

4. 🗓 Monthly Credit Reset

Every month, the system automatically resets credits.

Rules:

Each student gets 100 new credits.

You can carry forward up to 50 unused credits.

Sending limit also resets to 100 every month.

5.Leaderboard

A list that shows top-performing students based on total credits they’ve received.

Rules:

Sorted by total credits (highest first).

If two students have the same credits, the one with the smaller student ID comes first.

Also shows how many recognitions and endorsements they got.

You can choose how many top students to show (like top 10, top 50, etc.).


Checks all input (no missing or wrong data).

Blocks invalid transfers or redemptions.

Prevents duplicate endorsements.

Sanitizes inputs to avoid security issues.
